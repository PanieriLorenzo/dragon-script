The source code for the official toolchain is licensed under GPLv3, but this doesn't cover the syntax of the language itself. You're free to use our toolchain to build proprietary closed-source code if you want to, and you may license your source code as you want, as long as you don't include the source code of the DragonScript toolchain itself.

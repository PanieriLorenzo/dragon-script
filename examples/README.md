# Examples

The examples are numbered for ease of reference. Numbering follows a loose organization.

- Examples `000` to `099` serve to illustrate the core syntax of the language, they are *not* meant to illustrate any of the semantics, nor do they serve as adequate testing for more complex parsing scenarios.
    - `000` is hello world, `001` to `009` is currently unused.
    - `010` to `019` type literals of the language.
    - `020` to `021` expressions
    - `030` to `031` statements
